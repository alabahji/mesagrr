                    <h2>How to cope with lockdown</h2>
                    <p>
                        It’s important for you to look after your mental health, be aware of 
                        other people’s mental health and, ultimately, live in a safe, nice 
                        environment that feels like your home. We spoke to two wellbeing experts
                        for their advice on how to ensure all this during the autumn and winter 
                        lockdowns.

                    <h2>Combat Christmas loneliness </h2>
                    <p>
                        Whether you’re unable to visit family, have had to uninvite incoming guests
                        or will be spending the day alone, the new way of speding the day will come 
                        as a shock to all of us. One of the biggest worries right now will be how to 
                        cope with spending Christmas away from the                         people we love.

                    <h2>Your lockdown reading pile</h2>
                    <p>
                        For those with stacks and stacks of books in their TBR (to be read) piles at home,
                        the coronavirus lockdown might seem like a great opportunity.
                        For a lot of people, escaping in a good book has been the way to switch off
                        and relax in lockdown. There are books to inspire.
